# spring_mvc4_tutorial
Pluralsight example on Spring MVC 4

Another PluralSight tutorial that follows on from the previous Spring MVC tutorial. This tutorial features changes
in Spring MVC 4 and favours Java configuration via annotation as opposed to XML configuration used in older releases.

The web-app built in the tutorial will still be deployed as a WAR file to a Tomcat server as opposed to going down the 
Spring boot route. 

The tutorial allows for further understanding of the Spring framework and aids practice of IntelliJ shortcuts/hotkeys 
for Git/Github integration.

Topics covered:

- Spring MVC 4 configuration
- Spring MVC 4 architecture
- Spring MVC 4 controllers
- Spring MVC 4 views
- Spring MVC 4 validation
- Spring MVC 4 REST and Ajax
